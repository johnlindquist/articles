# John's Workspace and Workflow

![My Desk](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XFwIqJRibD8/VJm7F3j1VuI/AAAAAAAA7DA/HMdz1sDTSB8/w1827-h1028-no/20141223_115623.jpg)





## Spend Money

I've worked from home for almost my entire career. I'm not afraid to buy a nice chair, standing desk, nice monitors, keeping my computer upgraded, etc. They usually last a long time and I use them for **hours and hours** almost every single day. Invest in yourself.

## My Office and Recording Space

I use my small walk-in closet. It has just enough room for my desk and a chair.

I hung up some cheap thick blankets on the walls to keep the sound out. They're black so it almost looks classy if you don't look at the nails hanging from the ceiling.

You can go really expensive with Sound Booths, but I find my mic and compressor combo do a great job of only picking up my voice. So I don't worry about outside sound unless my kids are yelling :)

Also, I cut a small hole in the wall and put my actual computer box in the next room to keep the noise and heat out. It's worked out swimmingly.

## Audio Hardware

This mic is great at capturing your voice and only your voice. Before getting this, I'd been through a lot of "Blue" mics (snowball, yeti, yeti pro, Nessie) and none of them even compare. It's obviously a lot more expensive, but if this is your job, it's worth it.

[Focusrite Scarlett](http://www.bswusa.com/USB-Interfaces-Focusrite-Scarlett-Solo-P10760.aspx)

This guy is a plug n' play usb adapter for your mic. Nothing to install, it's instantly recognized as a new audio device in OSX and Windows. It has a couple gain knobs to play with if your voice gets "hot", but not much else. It has one job and it does it perfectly.

## Desktop Hardware

[Dell P2715Q Monitors](http://accessories.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&sku=210-ADOF)

I'd been waiting for quality 27" 4k monitors and I finally found them. These are gorgeous and give me plenty of real estate to record and edit. I've actually tried recording videos in 4k, but it's simply not worth the hard drive space that it takes up ;)

I'm a keyboard nut. I love mechnical keyboards (I prefer cherry mx blue keyswitches).

I'm also an advocate of [homerow computing](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/home-row-computing/), but that's another article for another day.

[Razer Orbweaver](http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-orbweaver)

While Orbweavers are made for gaming, they're also great for applications that don't let you customize the keyboard shortcuts. I use about 6 shortcuts in Final Cut Pro and I easily map them all to single keys on the Orbweaver to leave my right hand open for mouse movement. You can swap layouts on the Orbweaver for Photoshop or other mouse-heavy apps.

## Software

[SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)

![](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s7/sh/3b586cca-269c-4d8e-a8cf-fb49aa3f73eb/e8a4aa05a211c40ab1154ce14515d27c/res/60c8ae06-f9ce-4952-8b95-4377397c4513/skitch.png)

I know there are a ton of "Window Management" apps (and I've even written AppleScripts to accomplish the same thing), but SizeUp has the one feature that I haven't found in other apps that I need: The ability to customize the size of the "centered" window.

[Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/)

![](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s7/sh/7a0aa8b4-cf73-43ca-a019-83fa5035b412/2022e93db156f4e7041c041a71c3761f/res/ad4cd082-6e6f-4589-95ab-afd352d7db19/skitch.png)

Without Bartender, all of this annoying distracting stuff would display during every video. I don't want all that annoying stuff.

[iShowU HD Pro](http://www.shinywhitebox.com/ishowu-hd-pro)

![](https://shinywhitebox.com/media/images/ishowu-hd-application-icon.png)

iShowU is kind of ugly and maybe a little bit crashy at times, but it's dead simple. I'm a recent convert after giving up on ScreenFlow and Camtasia (both too buggy for my purposes). It basically just records a raw video then you get to edit it in whatever you want. 

[Final Cut Pro](http://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

![](http://images.apple.com/final-cut-pro/images/index_hero.jpg)

I honestly think it's funny that I use Final Cut Pro for something as simple as post-editing screen captures, but the editing experience is simply awesome:

* I can "split" or "blade" a clip without having the clip selected using cmd+B
* I can select a bladed clip underneath the playhead using "X" without having to use the mouse
* The timeline will scrub by simply moving the mouse (I don't have to drag or click)
* Deleting a split clip can automatically stitch the remaining clips back together (this is a huge time-saver when you record in many small chunks like I do)
* It's faster and more reliable than everything else I've tried
